# 5. (10 pt) Database backup/restore

**The goal**: understand what to do if everything is screwed up.

You should have a plan-B to not loose your (and your customer's) data and have a playbook how to restore the project in case of disaster.

1. Invoke entry-function from your project 10 times
2. Screenshot to show data stored in the database
3. Edit several records and screenshot the results
4. Restore the data to the state from clause `2`
