# 9. (10 pt) Observability: Logs, metrics, alerts

**The goal**: your project is _observable_.

Used cloud components emits application and audit logs, diagnostics data, metrics. You should be able to:

- perform a historical analysis of this data
- slice and dice the observations
- understand what happened at time X
- how system behavior changed between point Y and Z

Invoke your function several times and do the following exercises:

1. find logs in each of three functions related to the same request
2. find built-in metrics that might help you to understand Event Stream performance
3. compare average execution time of functions that read from Event Stream

### Deliveries

- documents and screenshots to show the answers to the exercises
